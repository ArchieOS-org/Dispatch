# Structural Debt Log

This is an **append-only** log of structural issues discovered during development.
Agents MUST log issues here rather than fixing them if they exceed the "Fix Small" threshold.

## Fix Small Threshold
Fix ONLY if ALL are true:
- ≤ 2 files modified
- ≤ 30 lines changed
- AND (blocks shipping OR prevents duplication OR improves correctness)

Otherwise: **CONTAIN and LOG here**.
