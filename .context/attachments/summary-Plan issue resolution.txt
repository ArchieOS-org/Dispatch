The user wants to implement a "glass" effect for the sidebar background on macOS, following the design language introduced in WWDC 2025.

**1. Primary Request and Intent:**

The user's primary request is to add a glass background to the macOS sidebar. The intent is to visually enhance the sidebar by implementing the "Liquid Glass" effect, which is a new translucent material introduced by Apple in WWDC 2025. The user wants to leverage existing `glassEffect` implementations and follow specific design guidelines for this new visual feature.

**2. Problem Solving:**

The main challenge is to correctly apply the new `glassEffect` modifier (or its fallback) to the existing sidebar implementation. This involves:
*   **Researching `glassEffect` API:** Understanding how to apply it to a rectangular area and selecting the appropriate variant (`.regular` vs. `.clear` vs. `.interactive`).
*   **Backward Compatibility:** Ensuring a fallback mechanism for macOS versions prior to the introduction of `glassEffect`. The plan suggests using `.regularMaterial` as a fallback.
*   **Integration:** Applying the modifier to the `ResizableSidebar` view without disrupting its current functionality (drag, collapse, content sampling).
*   **Testing:** Verifying the effect across different macOS versions, light/dark modes, and during sidebar interactions (resizing, collapsing, expanding).

**3. Files and Code Sections:**

*   **New File to Create:**
    *   `Dispatch/Design/Effects/GlassEffect.swift`: This file will be extended to include a new modifier `glassSidebarBackground()`.

*   **Files to Modify:**
    *   `Dispatch/Design/Effects/GlassEffect.swift`:
        *   Add the `glassSidebarBackground()` modifier. The proposed implementation includes:
            ```swift
            /// Applies a glass effect background for sidebars and panels on macOS 26+.
            /// Falls back to regularMaterial on earlier versions.
            @ViewBuilder
            func glassSidebarBackground() -> some View {
                #if os(macOS)
                if #available(macOS 26.0, *) {
                    self
                        .glassEffect(.regular) // Use .regular for static sidebar
                        .containerShape(RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 0)) // No corner radius for edge-to-edge
                } else {
                    self
                        .background(.regularMaterial) // Fallback for pre-macOS 26
                }
                #else
                self.background(.regularMaterial) // Fallback for non-macOS
                #endif
            }
            ```
    *   `Dispatch/Views/Components/macOS/ResizableSidebar.swift`:
        *   Apply the new `glassSidebarBackground()` modifier to the `sidebar()` view.
            ```swift
            if state.shouldShowSidebar {
                sidebar()
                    .frame(width: state.displayWidth)
                    .glassSidebarBackground()  // <-- Apply glass effect here
                    .clipped()
            }
            ```
        *   Potentially adjust the `HStack` or overlay to ensure the glass effect doesn't interfere with the `UnifiedDragHandle` or other content sampling if the effect is more complex. The plan indicates the current overlay structure should be compatible.
